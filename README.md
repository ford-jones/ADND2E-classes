# ADND2E

Welcome to my MMORPG prototype. 

I am currently working from the AD&D 2nd edition players handbook, converting player data and abilities into C++ classes. 
Presently the project contains optional player classes and races which will be used for character creation. Any ideas, critism, feedback or tips are warmly welcomed as I am new to C++ programming. 

The project is being compiled with g++ compiler, if you are using another compiler you may have to troubleshoot and refactor the following command line scripts.

# Compile the project:
```
g++ -o run races/*.cpp main.cpp
```

# Run the project:
```
./run
```
